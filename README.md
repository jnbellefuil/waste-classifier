Introduction 
With the escalating global waste crisis and increased emphasis on sustainability, accurate and 
efficient waste sorting is critical for improving recycling rates and reducing landfill overflow. 
This project explores the use of deep learning and machine learning models to classify waste 
images into nine distinct categories using the RealWaste Image Classification dataset. By 
comparing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
classifier enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we can evaluate their respective 
performance in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and generalization. 
Traditional waste sorting relies heavily on manual labor or simplistic sensor-based systems, both 
of which are error prone and inefficient. Improper waste disposal leads to contamination of 
recyclables, increased environmental pollution, and public health concerns. Automating waste 
classification using AI holds immense promise, particularly in smart city and smart bin 
applications. This project was motivated by two primary concerns: Environmental Justice: 
Disproportionate exposure to pollution in marginalized communities due to mismanaged waste. 
Practical AI Applications: Applying different machine learning techniques to tackle real-world 
sustainability challenges
